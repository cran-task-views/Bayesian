## CRAN Task View: Bayesian Inference

Applied researchers interested in Bayesian statistics are increasingly
attracted to R because of the ease of which one can code algorithms to
sample from posterior distributions as well as the significant number of
packages contributed to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) that
provide tools for Bayesian inference. This task view catalogs these
tools. In this task view, we divide those packages into four groups
based on the scope and focus of the packages. We first review R packages
that provide Bayesian estimation tools for a wide range of models. We
then discuss packages that address specific Bayesian models or
specialized methods in Bayesian statistics. This is followed by a
description of packages used for post-estimation analysis. Finally, we
review packages that link R to other Bayesian sampling engines such as
[JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/),
[OpenBUGS](http://www.openbugs.net/),
[WinBUGS](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/),
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), and
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

    logit, hierarchical negative binomial regression models, and linear
    instrumental variable models.

    such as particle filtering or whatever users write in its algorithm
    language.
